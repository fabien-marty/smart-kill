# smart-kill

## What is it?

This is a little CLI tool written in [Golang](https://go.dev/) to:
- send a configurable signal (`SIGTERM` for example) to a process (given its pid)
- wait for it to stop for a set period of time
- send a `SIGKILL` if necessary

If the unix result code is `0`, the PID does not exist any more. 

## Non-goals

- Windows support (sorry ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)

## How to install?

Go to [releases](https://github.com/fabien-marty/smart-kill/releases) and download the binary for your architecture.
Add the executable bit (`chmod +x`) and launch it.

Example without browser:

```console
OSARCH=linux-amd64
VERSION=v0.1.2
wget -O /usr/local/bin/smart-kill "https://github.com/fabien-marty/smart-kill/releases/download/${VERSION}/smart-kill-${VERSION}-${OSARCH}"
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/smart-kill
```

## How to use?

```console
$ ./smart-kill --help

## Roadmap

- [ ] multiple PIDs in parallel
- [ ] children handling
